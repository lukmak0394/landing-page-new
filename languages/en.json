    "about_description": "My name is ≈Åukasz Makowski. I created this website because I'd like to have my landing page where I could present my sample front-end projects. In Tech-Stack section you'll find technologies that I use in working with them. You can also contact me using the form at the bottom of the website and leave me a message. Please also feel free to download my resume as I'm also actively looking for the job where I'd have a possibility to use my front-end skills. <br><br> On my current position I'm mainly responsible for contacting goods vendors in order to get from them all significant information that must be visible on the deals which will be available for end customers on the website. I'm also partly account manager for my vendors as I'm a main point of contact for these assigned to me."
